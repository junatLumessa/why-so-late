# why-so-late

## Description:
Trains are sometimes late due to unexpected weather conditions. This makes it difficult for passengers to make their way to work, school, etc. It's hard to know for sure before hand when trains are late and in worst case, passenger has already walked all the way to the station.

Our aim is to help predict when trains are likely to be late on these kinds of circumstances. We use open weather and railway data provided by FIM and VR.
